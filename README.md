# Project Name: Visualization of Range and Charging Speed on a Map

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a visualization of the range and charging speed of electric cars on a map. It was developed by Groupe 3 APP2000 at USN BÃ¸ during the 2022/2023 academic year. The project spanned two semesters, with the Autumn semester dedicated to planning and learning the necessary programming languages, and the Spring semester focused on programming the website, testing, and writing an end report. The initial customer for this project was Aplia.

## APIs and Technologies Used
- NOBIL API from Nobil.no: The NOBIL API was used to retrieve data related to electric car charging stations.
- Google Maps API: The Google Maps API was utilized to display the map and integrate location-based functionalities.
- MongoDB: The chosen database for this project was MongoDB, which was used to store relevant data.
- React: The application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Express/Node.js: The REST API supporting the application was developed using Express, a web application framework for Node.js.

## Usage
The application allows users to perform the following actions:
1. Select an electric car by specifying the brand, model, and version.
2. Modify car settings within the same menu to change the car's range.
3. Select a starting point on the map (limited to "Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland").
4. Choose desired charging stations to obtain information or calculate the new range.
